Use Linux Mint OEM image, so each user gets to set own preferences

### Preparation of the 'vanilla' OEM image
+  Create new virtual machine with 16 Gb disk space called TW_devVM_vanilla
+  Install Linux from the .iso file (username oem, passwork TWAdm1n)
+  Restart the machine

### Preparation of the software and settings
+  Share the C:\dev, C:\dotfiles, T:\, X:\ and Y:\ drives with it
+  Start the new machine

Note that Linux Mint comes with the following installed:
virtualbox-guest-utils
virtualbox-guest-dkms
virtualbox-guest-x11
These are used to communicate with VirtualBox and have to be install manually in some other distributions.

+  Uncomment the ADD_EXTRA_GROUPS and EXTRA_GROUPS lines in /etc/adduser.conf
+  Add `vboxfs` to the list of extra groups
+  Add links to the shared directories:
```
ln -s /media/sf_dev /home/oem/dev
ln -s /media/sf_dotfiles /home/oem/dotfiles
ln -s /media/sf_T_DRIVE /home/oem/T
ln -s /media/sf_X_DRIVE /home/oem/X
ln -s /media/sf_Y_DRIVE /home/oem/Y
```

+  Setup desktop preferences e.g. background, panels

+  Copy all the files that you want all users to have to the /etc/skel directory.

```
sudo cp dev dotfiles X Y T Desktop .config
```

+ install media codecs
sudo apt-get install mint-meta-codecs

### Sharing the virtual machine image
+  Freeze TW_devVM_vanilla machine, then close and Save Machine State
+  Make a full clone of TW_devVM_vanilla, called TW_devVM
+  Start up TW_devVM
+  Run 'Prepare for shipping to end user' from the desktop
+  Delete desktop icon from the skeleton directory:
```
sudo rm /etc/skel/Desktop/Prepare\ for\ shipping\ to\ end\ user
```
+  Shutdown
+  Copy to T:/......
